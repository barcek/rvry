# rvry

Mark time passing in the terminal.

By default prints one dot per second, and when stopped with `q` or `Ctrl-C` shows the time elapsed.

## Script

The script can be run with the command `./rvry` while in the same directory, and from elsewhere using the pattern `path/to/rvry`. It can be run from any directory with `rvry` by a) placing it in the '/bin' or '/usr/bin' directory and b) making it executable, if not already, with `chmod+x rvry`.

The hashbang at the top of the file assumes the presence of Bash.
